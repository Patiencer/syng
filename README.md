## __About__
Syng is a free, open source, Chinese-To-English and English-To-Chinese Dictionary app that makes it easy to lookup words and phrases quickly. This service will be made for desktop operating systems, and there are no plans to build something for mobile platforms. _For a good mobile platform alternative the app [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/) is an excellent option._

### Name
Syng is a stylized spelling of Ciying, the Pinyin for 词应. 词应 has been shorted from 词典应用, literally translating to Dictionary App.
